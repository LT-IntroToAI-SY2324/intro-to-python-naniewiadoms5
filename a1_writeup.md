# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_ai_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## Options for Assignment 1
- Complete the `a1.py` file completely and answer the reflection questions in this file.  Mr. Berg will be looking at both files.
- Complete the `python_with_generative_ai.md` and put your programming portions in `a1_ai_problems.py`.

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

1. What is your initial thoughts about the python programming language?

Compared to other languages, I saw that a lot of the syntax is mitigated, like for example the tedious semicolons. It is also used commonly in machine learning programs.

2. Describe some similarities and differences that you found between python and other programming languages you have used in the past?

Definitely there are a lot of differences like the syntax and readability. It has more run time compared to other languages because of its own processing eases. A similarity is just the concepts between all programming languages like loops, "arrays", or types of variables, although there are also some unique aspects like specific functions that you yourself would have to program to complete a task in other languages, and in Python there are functions like pop() or slicing which I've never heard of before but have programmed those functions in Java.

3. What are some things that you learned through this assignment?

Like I stated in #2, I learned about unique Python functions like pop(), slicing, dictionaries etc. I also saw that if-else statements are written with colons and division in Python is with 2 slashes. Aside from Python, I also learned how to use GitHub too, like pushing, commiting and cloning.
